# Request to bump up to Advanced Track

Hi John,

Thank you for replying so quickly and for telling me more about your background. We are grateful to you for your remarkable academic achievements as well as your enthusiasm towards the Technical Interview Prep program.

I can see why you wish to be placed in the Advanced track and would like to assure you that our intention is to make the educational process as effective as possible. Our decision about the placement is based on technical interview skills and careful matching of students with tracks that will be most challenging and supportive.

**The Intermediate track has been recommended**, given your pre-work score, since it aligns with foundational knowledge required for a successful learning journey in our program. This approach ensures each participant is adequately prepared before moving onto more advanced material which can be crucial in realizing full value from this course.

**Here are brief course descriptions of each track:**
