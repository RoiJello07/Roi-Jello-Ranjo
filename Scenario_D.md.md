# Student who wants to be put back to the course after being withdrawn

Hi Dennis,

Thank you for reaching out and sharing your concerns about the missed coursework. We understand that unexpected situations can arise, and we appreciate your commitment to resolving this matter.

While we are unable to reinstate a student who has been dropped from the course due to non-compliance with our policies, we want to support your learning journey in other ways.

**All TIP101 modules will remain accessible through your GitHub account indefinitely**. This allows you to revisit and review the materials at your own pace. We highly encourage you to utilize these resources to reinforce your knowledge and complete any remaining assignments as you see fit.

If you have any questions or need help navigating these materials, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us **admissions@codepath.org**. We’re here to support your learning process and ensure you have the resources you need for future studies.

Thank you for your understanding, and we wish you the best of luck in your future academic endeavors.

All the best,
The CodePath.org Team
****
