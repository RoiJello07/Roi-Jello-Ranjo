# Subject: Eligibility for Technical Interview Prep Program

Hi Jane,

Thank you for your enthusiasm and the hard work you’ve put into building the Flix app. We truly appreciate your dedication.

We understand the frustration this may cause, and we apologize for any inconvenience. At the moment, our courses are only available to students enrolled in partner universities within the USA due to our current sponsorships and organizational policies.

While we can’t make exceptions right now, we are grateful for your interest and effort in applying. **We have previously offered courses in Haiti and Taiwan and are hopeful to expand our reach further in the future.**

In the meantime, we encourage you to review our [High-Level Software Interview Guide](htthttp://tinyurl.com/codepathinterviewguideps://), which might be helpful for your preparation.

Thank you once again for your understanding and commitment. We wish you the best of luck in all your future endeavors.

Warm regards,
The CodePath.org Team
