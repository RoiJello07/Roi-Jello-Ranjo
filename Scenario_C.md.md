# Subject: Applicant who missed the deadline

Hi Anne,

I’m truly sorry to hear that you missed the deadline for our Summer Interview Prep course and that you’re facing challenges in securing an internship. We understand how tough the job market can be, and it breaks our hearts to hear about your struggles.

Unfortunately, the course is currently full, and we have a long waiting list. Given that you’ll be graduating this Spring, reapplying for next year’s course won’t be an option. However, we want to support you in your job search as much as we can.

To assist you, we recommend checking out our [High-Level Software Interview Guide](hhttp://tinyurl.com/codepathinterviewguidettps://), which offers valuable tips and guidelines for interview preparation. 


We genuinely wish you the best of luck with your internship search and future endeavors. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please don’t hesitate to reach out.

All the best,
The CodePath.org Team
